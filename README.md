# 📊 Plugin Metrics Dashboard

Welcome to the **Plugin Metrics** project — an analytics dashboard for visualizing data collected from various sources! 🚀

🛠️ **Purpose**: The Plugin Metrics Dashboard is designed to display detailed analytical data, pulling metrics from a data collector that operates on the same MySQL database. It shows this data in a variety of charts, graphs, and other visualizations with date filters.

## 🌐 Description

**Plugin Metrics** is a data visualization platform built using **TypeScript**, **MySQL**, and **Chart.js** (or another charting library). It retrieves analytics data from a backend system (data collector) and visualizes the metrics through graphs and charts. This allows users to track and analyze trends over time, such as usage statistics, user activity, or performance metrics.

### Key Features:
- 📊 Display metrics in dynamic charts (line, bar, pie, etc.)
- 📅 Filter data by specific dates or ranges
- 🔄 Real-time data updates
- 📈 Visualize multiple datasets (e.g., user activity, plugin performance)
- 🔗 Integrated with a data collector that stores data in a shared MySQL database

## 🚀 Technologies

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Vue.js, Chart.js (or other charting libraries)
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: MySQL (used by both the data collector and the analytics dashboard)

## 🛠️ Features

- 📈 Interactive charts to visualize key metrics.
- 🔄 Real-time updates on metrics.
- 🗓️ Date range selection to filter data.
- 📉 Multiple chart types (bar, line, pie) to analyze data in different ways.
